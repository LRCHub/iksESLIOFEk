[00:09.12] It was my weakest night between the dark and light
[00:20.93] The look in your eyes and disturbing surprise
[00:26.39] I could not see wrong from right
[00:42.39] 
[00:32.78] But I never really was the purest one
[00:38.27] Though I try to cleanse my soul with every sun
[00:43.65] And I just get deeper in the same shit doesn't everyone
[00:50.00] Close my eyes and play along
[01:04.00] 
[00:54.53] Cause I am a tempted girl
[00:59.94] This is a candied world
[01:05.46] And it spreads like fire
[01:08.19] And when it devours me I call the burning fun
[01:30.69] 
[01:16.38] But I never really was the purist one
[01:23.60] Though I try to cleanse my soul with every sun
[01:29.19] And I just get deeper in the same shit doesn't everyone
[01:34.56] Close my eyes and play along
[01:48.56] 
[01:41.84] Can I hush my conscience around you
[01:47.39] If I could take it all back
[01:51.89] Will I lie and suffocate my impulses
[01:57.33] I'll never leave them behind
[02:03.60] Will I
[02:06.60] 
[02:14.66] But I never really was the purest one
[02:21.09] Though I try to cleanse my soul with every sun
[02:25.57] And I just get deeper in the same shit doesn't everyone
[02:31.90] Close my eyes and play along
[02:45.90] 
[02:37.34] Will I fly closer to heaven
[02:43.70] If I don't get what I want
[02:48.21] Will you ever see the innocence you knew in me
[02:54.69] I'll never be her again
[03:06.19] 
[03:22.71] But I never really was the purest one
[03:28.22] Though I try to cleanse my soul with every sun
[03:32.70] And I just get deeper in the same shit doesn't everyone
[03:39.13] Close my eyes and play along
[03:53.13] 
[03:45.55] I never lied to you
