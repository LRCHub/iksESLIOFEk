It was my weakest night between
the dark and light
The look in your eyes and
disturbing surprise
I could not see wrong from right
But I never really was the
purest one
Though I try to cleanse my soul
with every sun
And I just get deeper in the
same shit doesn’t everyone
Close my eyes and play along
Cause I am a tempted girl
This is a candied world
And it spreads like fire
And when it devours me I call
the burning fun
But I never really was the
purist one
Though I try to cleanse my soul
with every sun
And I just get deeper in the
same shit doesn’t everyone
Close my eyes and play along
Can I hush my conscience around
you
If I could take it all back
Will I lie and suffocate my
impulses
I’ll never leave them behind
Will I
But I never really was the
purest one
Though I try to cleanse my soul
with every sun
And I just get deeper in the
same shit doesn’t everyone
Close my eyes and play along
Will I fly closer to heaven
If I don’t get what I want
Will you ever see the innocence
you knew in me
I’ll never be her again
But I never really was the
purest one
Though I try to cleanse my soul
with every sun
And I just get deeper in the
same shit doesn’t everyone
Close my eyes and play along
I never lied to you
