I wonder if you know: Is this the last time, my eyes on you?
It's the strangest thing you'll ever see and be a part of
Where you are I'm sensing danger; it's pouring down

Scrutinizing the world inside and out
I try to change it to make you safe
It's the strangest thing you'll ever see and be a part of
Innocent and born untainted; the purest form

From birth to death, let us dance among the stars
Don't let go of my hands 'til I say release
Laugh your way through life and keep your head high, but
You better build a shelter, for they spread
Hate and atrocity
They feed on fear and animosity
They spread hate

My love for you the purest one with heart made of gold
It will succeed to fill up the void of those
Whose lies are considered the law
The moon has now turned red and the stars have aligned
As you've been waltzing around the time
Turned ripe to switch from gloom to joy
